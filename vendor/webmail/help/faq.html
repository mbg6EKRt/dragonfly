	<a name="1" class="wmh_txt"><b>1. Fatal error: Allowed memory size of [###] bytes exhausted (tried to allocate [###] bytes) in [path]/[file].php on line [###]</b></a><br>
	<br>
This error caused by limitation of memory available for PHP script.
<br><br>
Increase the PHP configuration setting memory_limit (see the [PHP
manual]). After editing the PHP configuration file, you will probably
need to restart your webserver. Check your server manual to find out
how to do that.
<br><br>
You should add the following line (or change existing) into your php.ini file:
<br><br>
memory_limit = 60M
<br><br>
We recommend you to specify not lesser than 50M because large messages require additional memory for processing.
	<br>
</p><br>

<p class="wmh_reg">
	<a name="2" class="wmh_txt"><b>2. Administration settings disappeared. Why?</b></a><br>
	<br>
First, make sure the correct path to the WebMail data folder is
specified in inc_settings_path.php file.
<br><br>
Common reason of settings not being saved is read-only permission to
the WebMail data folder or its contents. Check whether Internet Guest Account (or Apache user for Unix/Linux platform) has "write" permission over the data folder and all its contents.	<br>
</p><br>

<p class="wmh_reg">
	<a name="3" class="wmh_txt"><b>3. Error while attaching files to messages. Please advice.</b></a><br>
	<br>
The most common reason of this issue is that attachments size is limited in PHP
 configuration. To increase the limit, open your php.ini file and locate the
  following lines:
<br><br>
upload_max_filesize = 2M
<br>
post_max_size = 8M
<br><br>
You should set these limits according to your needs, but post_max_size should
 be equal to at least upload_max_filesize * 2.
<br><br>
Another common problem with attachments is insufficient permissions for
 attachments folder ("Path For Upload Attachments" defined in Administration
 panel). IIS anonymous user (IUSR_YOUR_SERVER_NAME) must have "Full Control"
 permission to this folder.
<br><br>
Also, if you are using IIS 6, size of a file that can be uploaded onto the
 server is limited to 200K by default. You can increase this limit according to
 you needs. To do this, type "notepad %WINDIR%\system32\inetsrv\MetaBase.xml"
 in command line, search for the "AspMaxRequestEntityAllowed" property, and
 specify necessary size in bytes, then save this file. Please note, "Enable
 Direct Metabase Edit" must be turned on, in other case, you will not be able
 to edit this file. To check this option, look at your host properties in
 Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.
